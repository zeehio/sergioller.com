# About me

![Sergio Oller](/mypermanent.php?slug=face)

I am Sergio Oller Moreno. I am an optimistic person who enjoys
researching, solving problems, helping colleagues and teaching.

Currently I am a PhD. student at the 
[Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia](http://ibecbarcelona.eu).

I am working on signal and data processing for biological data, with focus
on Gas Chromatography--Ion Mobility Spectrometry applications.

During my PhD, I worked at the Molecular Biomarkers Core in the Nestl√© 
Institute of Health Sciences, as a Omics Data Analyst and Research
Assistant.

I have a Bachelor's degree in Physics and a Master in Computational and 
Applied Physics. I like signal and data processing, programming and 
machine learning and I enjoy applying what I know to solve problems that 
can lead to practical applications.

I also enjoy defending and promoting Free (Libre) Software, and --on my 
free time-- I try to contribute to the Debian Linux distribution.
