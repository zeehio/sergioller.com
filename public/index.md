# About me

**Hi!** I'm Sergio Oller Moreno. I'm an optimistic person who enjoys
researching, solving problems, helping colleagues and teaching.

Currently I'm a PhD. student at the 
[Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia](http://ibecbarcelona.eu), working on signal
and data processing for biological data, with focus on Gas
Chromatography--Ion Mobility Spectrometry applications.

I have a Bachelor's degree in Physics and a Master in Computational and 
Applied Physics. I like signal and data processing, programming and 
machine learning and I enjoy applying what I know to solve problems that 
can lead to practical applications.

I also enjoy defending and promoting Free (Libre) Software, and --on my 
free time-- I try to contribute to the Debian Linux distribution.

Things I've done or significantly contributed to:

## Code

 - Make parallelization easier with [parmap](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/parmap) (2015) `[python]` 
 - Print DataFrames and tables with conditional
   formatting using [condformat](2016-03-10-condformat-release.md) (2015) `[R]`
 - See my list of [reported and fixed bugs](bug_reports.md).
