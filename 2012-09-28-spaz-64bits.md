# Audio error in Space Pirates and Zombies

I recently bought the [Humble Indie Bundle 6](https://www.humblebundle.com/),
which among very nice games, it has "Space Pirates and Zombies".
When playing it I had this sound related error:

        AL lib: oss.c:168: Could not open /dev/dsp: No such file or directory

In order to fix this error, please run:

        sudo apt-get install libasound2-plugins:i386

I have read that the ia32-libs package also solves the problem, however the ia32-libs 
package will also install many other libraries that are not needed.
